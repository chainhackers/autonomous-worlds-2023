# **TimePirates**

**TimePirates** is a ChainHackers' entry for the "Autonomous Worlds 2023" hackathon. This blockchain-based game merges exploration, survival, and modularity, presenting a player-driven universe with infinite expansion potential.

## **Exploration and Survival**

Set in an infinite, square-grid world, players move around, collecting randomly appearing time packages. Encounters turn into combat, with the victor claiming the defeated player's time reserves.

## **Modularity and Player-Created Content**

Players can reserve sections of the world using on-chain smart contracts, defining their specific game rules. This creates diverse "mini-games" across the world, each varying in design and complexity.

## **Blockchain Integration**

All interactions, from area reservations to player conflicts, are tracked and validated on-chain. This blockchain enforcement adds a layer of credibility and transparency to the game.

## **Development Scope**

With a one-week development timeframe, the ChainHackers team aims to create a few example game worlds, with complexity akin to the "Snake" game.

**TimePirates** offers a unique, ever-changing gaming environment. Blockchain technology facilitates composable gaming experiences, ensuring every journey in this infinitely expandable universe is distinct.
